Description:

This Arduino Project measures the temperature from two sensors and indicate whether the two sensor readings are above 40 degrees celsius. The project consists of Arduino Uno, Temperature Sensor DS18B20, Breadboard, Green and Red LED, 1k Ohm resistor, and 22 gauge wires. The Arduino requires a personal computer with Arduino IDE installed, which can be found https://www.arduino.cc. Please refer to the website to download the app. 

The following Repository consists of:
<ul>
    <li> Arduino-Temperature-Control-Library-master.zip</li> The following zip file is from
         https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/TheGadgetBoy/ds18b20-digital-temperature-sensor-and-arduino-9cc806
    <li> OneWire.zip </li> Also obtained from website reference above
    <li> Temperature.ino </li> Arduino file which displays the LED Green when two temperature sensors are 40 degrees celsius
         or above. Else, the LED displays Red.
    <li> README.md </li> The summary is written in Markdown langauge
</ul>
